# ELLIFANT - An application for all your r-table ellipsoid fitting needs


**ELLIpsoid Fitting and Adjusting Numeric Tool**, or ELLIFANT, is a python application that allows users to adjust ellipsoids to their r-table measurements, and find the best fitting partitions for their data.

For this guide, basic understanding of what an r-table is and how it is used is assumed. For more information on r-tables, please refer to (Val√©rie Muzet).

We also assume good knowledge of the 2020 paper by Ana Ogando-Martinez *et al.* (Ana Ogando-Martinez *et al.*), which describes the ellipsoid fitting algorithm that serves as a basis for this application.

## Installation

To install ELLIFANT, simply clone the repository and put it in a directory of your choice.
You will need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine, and use pip or conda to install the following packages:

- numpy
- pandas 
- matplotlib
- argparse
- multiprocessing

Further instructions on how to install these packages can be found on their respective websites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Pip should be all you need to install the 5 packages,
just type `pip install <package_name>` in your terminal once you have installed Python and pip.

## Usage

Use `cd` to navigate to the directory where you have installed ELLIFANT, and down into the src folder.

To run ELLIFANT, simply type `python3 ellifant.py` in your terminal. 
For windows machines, you may need to type `py ellifant.py` instead.

But most likely, this will return you an error message, as you need to specify what data you want it to run on and what you want it to do with it, adding the -help flag will show you the different options you have, but I will go through them here as well.

You can put all command line arguments in any order you like, some values will return errors, but the order of the arguments themselves does not matter.

You can use either the short or long and comprehensive version of the arguments, for example, -ea and --ellipsoidAdjusting are interchangeable.

## Functions

The app has 3 main functions, fitting ellipses and searching for the best fitting partitions, either along the beta vector or over the whole r-table. (see the report for more information on the algorithm)

- -ea | --ellipsoidAdjusting : Adjusts the ellipsoids to the r-table measurements according to the stops vector

- -bga | --betaGeneticAlgorithm : Searches for the best fitting partition of beta for the provided data using a genetic algorithm

- -pga | --partitionGeneticAlgorithm : Searches for the best fitting partition of the whole r-table for the provided data using a genetic algorithm

You must specify one and only one of these functions per command line call.

## More command line arguments

- -fp | --folderPath : Path to the folder containing the r-tables you want to run ELLIFANT on, the path should be relative to the data folder of the application, ELLIFANT comes with a few databases to toy with, but you can add your own next to them.

- -p | --patron : Patron of the .xlsx folders you want to run ELLIFANT on, for example, `-p *.xlsx` is the default value, since the app only parses excel files, but you can specify a more specific patron, for example, `-p *-rtable.xlsx` will only run ELLIFANT on files that end with -rtable.xlsx

- -s | --sheets : If you only want to parse a few sheets of the files, you cans specify them here, for example, `-s R1,R2,R3` will only parse the sheets R1, R2 and R3 of the files.

- -i | --ignore : This is the opposite of the sheets argument, it allows you to ignore certain sheets, for example, `-i R1,R2,R3` will parse all sheets except R1, R2 and R3.

- -sf | --saveFolder : This is the folder where the results of your computations will be saved, it is the results folder of the application by default, but you can specify a different folder if you want to.

- -sif | --saveImagesFolder : This is the folder where the images of your computations will be saved, it is the images folder of the application by default, but you can specify a different folder if you want to.

- -sdn | --saveDataName : This is the name of the file where the results of your computations will be saved, it defaults to `results`.

#### Boolean arguments (no value needed, typing them will set them to True)

<span style="color:red">Do not forget this argument if you want to save your results !</span> 

- -sd | --saveData : Saves the results of your computations in different formats depending on what you requested, the files will be saved in the results folder of the application (or the folder you specified with the -sf argument).

- -si | --saveImages : Saves the images you want according to the plotTypes and styles you requested, the images will be saved in the images folder of the application.

- -sh | --showImages : Shows the matplotlib plots as they are computed, this is useful if you want to see the plots but do not want to save them, this is compatible with the saveImages argument.

- -v | --verbose : makes the application print more information about what it is doing, this is useful if you want to see the progress of the computations, but it can be a bit overwhelming if you are running a lot of files.
